# neurotic-creature

I made that project from scratch in javascript which combine genetic algorithm and neuronal network.

Genetic algorithm is here to replace back propagation in neuronal network. We let our creatures correct the network themselves.

## Last project

Genetic art : https://github.com/dylandoamaral/genetic-art

### My improvements

 - Best code organisation
 
## To do

 - Create a CSS environment adding button to export result, to start and stop the algorithm
 - Add a test zone for best creature to see if the neuronal network is available
 - Create some predators which also have a neuronal network
 - Comment my code
 
## To fix

 - Import with javascript ES6
 - The "extinction" which occur sometimes for no reasons
